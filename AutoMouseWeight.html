<p>AutoMouseWeight is a Raspberry Pi Python program to automatically weigh and log weight data for individuals identified by RFID tags. It requires a load cell connected to an <a href = "https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879">HX711 load cell amplifier</a>, and an <a href="http://id-innovations.com/httpdocs/default.htm">Innovations Design</a> RFID tag reader (ID-3LA, ID-12LA, or ID-20LA). AutoMouseWeight was designed for mice, but it could be used for anything that can move and carry an RFID tag.</p>

<p>The basic setup of the electronics and hardware and the use of the system to log mice weights has been published:
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027017301218">Automating mouse weighing in group homecages with Raspberry Pi micro-computers. Omid Noorshams Jamie D. Boyd, and Timothy H. Murphy: Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 2017 Jun 15;285:1-5.</a> This is an improved version of the software used in the paper. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj43hAdYo34">youTube movie</a> demonstrating the electronics setup. The STL files included here were created by Omid Noorshams and are for 3D printing of a tunnel that rests on the load cell, related couplers, plus a holder for an ID-20LA. Their use is explained in the paper.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>AutoMouseWeight uses the HX711 Python/C module from <a href="https://github.com/jamieboyd/GPIO_Thread">GPIO_Thread</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jamieboyd/RFIDTagReader">RFIDTagReader</a>.</p>
<p>To install the HX711 Python/Cmodule you will need the Python development library. The GPIO_Thread projects use the <a href="https://github.com/jamieboyd/pulsedThread">pulsedThread library</a> so you will need to install this as well.<br>
<ol><li>sudo apt-get install python3-dev</li>
	<li>git clone https://githib.com/jamieboyd/pulsedThread</li>
	<li>cd pulsedThread</li>
	<li>make</li>
	<li>sudo make install</li>
</ol>
This installs the pulsedThread library.
<ol>
	<li>git clone https://githib.com/jamieboyd/GPIO_Thread</li>
	<li>cd GPIO_Thread</li>
	<li>sudo python3 HX711_setup.py install</li></ol>
This installs the Python/C++ module HX711 plus a Python module, Scale, that wraps the HX711 in a Python class.</p>

<p>Install RFIDTagReader:
<ol><li>git clone https://githib.com/jamieboyd/RFIDTagReader</li>
	<li>cd RFIDTagReader</li>
	<li>sudo python3 RFIDTagReader_setup.py install</li></ol>
This installs the RFIDTagReader Python module.</p>

<h3>Settings From JSON file</h3>
<p>There are some settings that need to be configured before running the program. These used to be set in the Python file itself, but have been moved into a JSON styled text file. When the program is launched, it will look for a file named AMW_config.jsn in the current directory, and load the constants from there. If the file can not be loaded completely, a new set of constants will be created by querying the user, and these will be saved to AMW_config.jsn.  A file named Copy_to_AMW_config.jsn contains a sample configuration file, which you can, as indicated, copy to AMW_config.jsn and manually edit. Don't edit Copy_to_AMW_config.jsn because if it is under GIT version control. You would lose your changes if you updated the program with git pull. The contents of AMW_config.jsn are:<br>

<h3>Running AutoMouseWeight</h3>
<p>Upon being started, AutoMouseWeight tares the scale, and opens a binary data file named for cage name and date. The program then loops forever collecting weight data whenever a tag is read by the Tag Reader. The program will close the existing file and start a new data file every 24 hours, synched to the kDAYSTARTHOUR constant. It can run constantly for many days at a time.</p>

<p>The basic program flow is as follows. Whenever a tag is read by the tag reader, the program records the tag ID number and the time, and starts the scale collecting weight data as fast as it can. This is done on a separate thread from the main program in C module. The scale keeps reading weights into the array until the array is full, or until the tag goes out of range and the scale reads leads than kMINWEIGHT, or until a different tag is read by the tag reader. The tag ID and the time stamp are then printed to the data file, followed by the contents of the data array up to the point where the scale was stopped.</p>

<p>The collection of data can be interrupted with ctrl-c. This brings up the ScaleRunner function which presents a text based menu with the following options:
<ol><li>Tare the scale with average of 10 readings</li>
<li>Weigh once</li>
<li>Weigh 10 times and print the average weight</li>
<li>Set the scale to low power mode</li>
<li>Wake the scale from low power mode</li>
<li>Test the threaded read</li>
<li>Exit the ScaleRunner and return to collecting weight data</li>
<li>Quit the AutoMouseWeight program</li></ol>
This can be used for testing the scale at any time. It may be useful to tare the scale from time to time. With mice, for instance, bits of bedding may be deposited in the scale chamber. Taring the scale at the start of every day could be added to the program. Selecting 6 will quit the scaleRunner function and return to collecting weight data. Selecting 7 will exit the AutoMouseWeight program, first closing the currently open data file.</p>

<h3>AutoMouseWeight Data</h3>
<p>AutoMouseWeight Data files for each day are named with kCAGE_NAME_4 Digit year_2 Digit Month_2 Digit Day, e.g., cage1_2017_06_04, and are saved in the location specified by kCAGE_PATH. Data files are in binary 32 bit floating point format. Weight data is written to the file as grams. Each run of weight data is prefaced by the last 6 digits of the RFID code, as a negative value to make it easy for analysis code to find the start of each run, and the time in seconds since the start of the day, as set by the kDAYSTARTHOUR constant. Only the last 6 digits of the RFID code are written because that is the limit of the precision of a 32 bit floating point value. In practice, this limit has not proved to be a problem.

<p>As the mouse moves across the platform, weight values start out low, rapidly reach a plateau, and then drop quickly as the mouse leaves the platform on the other side. 20 runs of data from the same mouse all from the same day are shown below. The plateau, easily seen when multiple runs are plotted together, corresponds to the actual weight of the mouse.<br>

<h3>AutoMouseWeight Data Analysis</h3>
<p>A second Python script, OneDayWeights.py, is included with AutoMouseWeight. It can be run seprately to analyze the data files produced by AutoMouseWeight, or if kSAVE_DATA_LOCAL is set in kSAVE_DATA, the get_day_weights function is imported from OneDayWeights.py and is run at the end of every day. The get_day_weights function uses the numpy library:<br>
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy<br>
If running OneDayWeights stand alone, you may wish to set the option to display plots of the data. This is done with matplotlib:</p>
sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib</p>

<p>The get_day_weights function is called like this:<br>
get_day_weights (folder_path, cageName, date_year, date_month, date_day, output_path, doPlots, sendMail)
<ul><li>folder_path --  path to the folder where the raw data files are</li>
	<li>cageName -- cage name, as set by AutoMouseWeight program, file names start with this</li>
	<li>date_year -- 4 digit year</li>
	<li>date_month -- 2 digit month</li>
	<li>date_day -- 2 digit day</li>
	<li>output_path --  path to folder where the outout text files will be saved</li>
	<li>doPlots -- if this boolean is true, graphs of intermediate stages of analysis will be displayed</li>
	<li>sendMail -- if this boolean is true, e-mails containing weight data will be sent to addresses listed in kRECIPIENTS</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The analysis used in OneDayWeights.py is quite simple, based on finding the most commonly ocurring weight for each mouse. For each day, weights for each mouse is copied into a numpy array. Weights below a minimum threshold (set by the constant kMIN_WEIGHT) or above a maximum threshold (set by the constant kMAX_WEIGHT) are excluded. A cumulative histogram of the weight data is made, using the bin size set by the constant kHIST_BINSIZE. The derivative of the histogram is taken, and smoothed with kN_SMOOTH passes of a Gaussian kernel of kKERNEL_WIDTH. The center of the histogram bin containing the maximum value of the smoothed derivative is returned as the result. The data for each day is saved in the folder specified by output_path, in a text file named cageName + '_weights_' + 4 Digit year_2 Digit Month_2 Digit Day + '.txt'  Sample output is:

<h3>Emailing Results</h3>
<p>If the Pi recording weights is online, email containing the results for each day can be sent to to interested parties. Constants used for emailing weights are set from the AMW_config.jsn file. Fill these in before running the program. Note that the email password is saved as clear text, not encoded. You can make a separate gmail account for your AutoMouseWeight. The emailing code could be improved by comparing each mouse's weight to a baseline weight, and sending an email alert only if the current weight had decreased by some set percentage from baseline.</p>

<h3>Running OneDayWeights Stand-Alone</h3>
<p>When run as a stand alone script, OneDayWeights.py repeatedly querries the user for a year, month, and date, and runs the get_day_weights function with other arguments set from constants in OneDayWeights.py:<br> 
<ul><li>kDATA_FOLDER -- where input binary data files are located</li>
	<li>kOUTPUT_FOLDER -- where output text fiels are saved</li>
	<li>kCAGE_NAME -- names of data files start with cage name</li>
	<li>kDO_PLOTS -- if true, program will stop and display plots of raw data and smoothed derivative</li>
	<li>kSEND_MAIL -- if true, email will be sent to list from kRECIPIENTS</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Matplotlib plots of the data from one day from one mouse are shown here, followed by a plot of the smoothed derivative of the histogram of all the weights, from which the position of the peak was extracted for the recorded weight. A particularly noisy example was selected to show that, with enough traversals across the weighing platform, a reliable peak can be extracted even from noisy data.
